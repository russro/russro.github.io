## Context:

> About a decade ago, the cardiovascular research group at Novartis began investigating a potential drug target for heart failure. But while none of the available methods yielded useful results, a new approach for studying miniature muscles turned out to be a perfect match for what the group needed. The resulting mini-heart platform has since developed into a powerful research tool.

The cardiovascular research group at Novartis opted to use 3D organoids (human skin iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) cultured on a pair of flexible silicone posts. This protocol allowed for imaging and <span class="highlight">measuring tissue contractility as a physiological readout</span> when subjecting the samples to novel drug candidates. In order to differentiate tissue culture into cardiomyocytes, scientists electrically stimulated the samples using electrodes.

## Problem:

When I joined the project, scientists were conducting these experiments on 96-well plates (shape: 8 rows by 12 columns), but they were only utilizing 8 of the wells per plate. This is because the electrical stimulator's form factor did not allow for utilizing all the wells of the plate. In other words, the stimulation tool was too big and had too few electrodes.
