Mitochondria are organelles with remarkably complex biophysical structures that have poorly understood mechanical behaviors. These subcellular structures have dynamic morphologies that adapt to the many intricate biological processes within the cell. They stretch, elongate, shrink, bend, and even "bead" almost as if they were cells themselves! I joined Gav Sturm for a rotation project in order to help better understand the remarkable dynamics of mitochondria.

We approached the problem using a data-driven heuristic. Gav ultimately wanted to capture a biophysical model
