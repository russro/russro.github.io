Nice to meet you! My name's Russell. 

I like designing and building **end-to-end systems** for <span class="highlight">automated experimentation</span>, <span class="highlight">data processing</span>, and <span class="highlight">machine learning/AI data analytics</span>.

I am currently pursuing a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley within the [Department of Bioengineering](https://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Dr. Reza Abbasi-Asl](https://abbasilab.org/).

In the past, I have...
