Nice to meet you! My name's Russell. 

I like designing and building **end-to-end systems** for <span class="highlight">automated experimentation</span>, <span class="highlight">data processing</span>, and <span class="highlight">machine learning/AI data analytics</span>.

I am currently pursuing a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley within the [Department of Bioengineering](https://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Dr. Reza Abbasi-Asl](https://abbasilab.org/) and fully funded by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

In the past, I have...
* Designed a [high-throughput screening (HTS) system for phenotyping cardiovascular drugs](/portfolio/2022-07_novartis_hts_system/) @ [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/research-and-development), enhancing their computer vision-based drug discovery platform ([article](https://live.novartis.com/article/how-a-drug-target-challenge-gave-rise-to-a-powerful-technology-platform/technology-for-the-heart)),
* Tested [novel perturbation algorithms on medical large language models (LLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10527) to expose model vulnerabilities via adversarial entity sampling,
* [Generated synthetic image data](/portfolio/2023-05_mitogan/) using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for training and simulating mitochondrial dynamics,
* [and more...](/CV/)
